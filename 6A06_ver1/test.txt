This is my first version of passage analyser.
It can count the number of characters, number of words, number of paragraphs, number of sentenences, reading time, reading ease score and number of unique words.
A unique_words.csv will be generated in the same folder each time you run the program.
There is also a Find function to count the occurrence of a specific word.
Put your text file of your passage in the same folder as the program.
