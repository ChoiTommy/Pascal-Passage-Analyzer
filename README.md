# Grandmaly - A  feature-poor passage analyzer

This project is created for 2020 HKDSE Information and Communication Technology School-based assessment. _Grandmaly_ is a simple passage analyzer that aims to provide basic (but **inaccurate**) statistics for your primary-school level composition. So before submitting your childish, poor-organized, vocabulary-insufficient piece of writing to your English teacher, remember loading it into _Grandmaly_, she will help you take a look on it, and give you brief (sometime useless) feedback to the passage, like a grandma. ~~(Actually not related)~~
